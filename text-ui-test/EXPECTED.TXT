Very well, sir, I am now adding this task:
[T][ ] Buy groceries
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.

On what date will this task be due, sir? (YYYY-MM-DD)
And at what time, sir? (HH:MM)

I'm afraid I cannot do that, sir. The date and time must be a valid datetime in the format YYYY-MM-DD and HH:MM respectively.
Please try again. What is your next command?
