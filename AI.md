# AI Usage Notes

## General

Copilot completions were used to help repetitive elements - once I typed code in a certain format style for the UI, if repetitive pieces of code such as overloaded method signatures were present copilot aided in this, speeding up the process.

## A-MoreTesting & A-JUnit

GitHub Copilot was used to aid in generation of tests using the ByteArrayInputStream and ByteArrayOutputStream. It was useful as I haven't used this library before and didn't know previously how to test the CLI input and output.

## A-BetterGui

ChatGPT was used to support the development of the CSS to look more stylised. It really helped achieve the look I wanted and responded well to feedback and adjustments.
